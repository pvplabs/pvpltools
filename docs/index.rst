PV Performance Labs' Tools for Python
=====================================

This package, ``pvpltools``, makes available a collection of useful
software components and functions created by PV Performance Labs.
Many were developed in the context of consulting or research projects,
sometimes as a necessity, and sometimes just to make life easier.

The aim of this package is to make life easier for people facing similar needs
and so, in a small way, contribute to the transition from fossil fuels
to renewable sources--and solar energy in particular.

The current version of this package is found on github as
`pvplabs/pvpltools
<https://github.com/pvplabs/pvpltools>`.
Prior to 2024, the code was published as
`adriesse/pvpltools-python
<https://github.com/adriesse/pvpltools-python>`_.
This older repository will remain in place, but will not be updated.


The package ``pvpltools`` is compatible with and complementary to
`pvlib python <https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io>`_.
