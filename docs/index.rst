PV Performance Labs' Tools for Python
=====================================

This package, ``pvpltools``, makes available a collection of useful
software components and functions created by PV Performance Labs.
Many were developed in the context of consulting or research projects,
sometimes as a necessity, and sometimes just to make life easier.

The aim of this package is to make life easier for people facing similar needs and so, in
a small way, contribute to the transition from fossil fuels
to renewable sources--and solar energy in particular.
